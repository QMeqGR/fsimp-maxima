This code implements a simplification routine for Maxima CAS
expressions using the core simplification routines for expressions
invovling trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, polynomial and
other functions.

The algorithm used in fullsimp is a poor-man's kind of simulated
annealing algorithm. It's poor-man's because it isn't really the
simulated annealing algorithm, but rather simply allows intermediate
expression lenghts to become slightly larger while searching for a
smaller and simpler expression.
