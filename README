This code was adapted from David Scherfgen's dssimp.mac code
posted on the Maxima discussion list.

This code implements a simplification routine for Maxima CAS
expressions using the core simplification routines for expressions
invovling trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, polynomial and
other functions.

The algorithm begins by searching through an expression for e.g. trig,
log, exp, etc. and choosing a set of core simplification
routines. Then it runs a poor-man's kind of simulated annealing
routine. It's poor-man's because it's not really simulated annealing,
but while it cycles through various core simplification routines
(several times) it allows the intermediate expression to become
slightly larger if it ultimately becomes smaller. The output is always
the smallest size expression, where the size is computed by the lisp
routine from David's original code.
